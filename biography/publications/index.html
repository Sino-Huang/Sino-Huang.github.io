Integrating natural language into current AI system is a promising direction to democratize AI technology. Moreover, the vast knowledge embedded in natural language presents an opportunity to enhance AI-driven decision-making.

Imagine you want to instruct an AI system in Minecraft to build a house. Instead of programming a detailed set of construction rules or crafting reward functions that require expert insight, you simply tell the AI:
  “Build a two-story house with a garden, using bricks for the walls and wood for the roof.”
A natural language (NL)-integrated sequential decision making (SDM) system shall leverage its understanding of natural language to break down this instruction into a series of actionable steps, and progressing to the desired goal you want!

Problem (TL;DR)
The current design of these natural language-integrated AI systems has significant room for improvement. For example, the algorithms often lack robustness and efficiency, which undermines the reliability of sequential decision making.

  Know more about the problem setting (two paradigms for sequential decision-making)
  

There are two primary paradigms for sequential decision-making: imagine you are playing Minecraft — a complex, open-ended problem-solving environment where players can build, explore, and survive. There are two ways you might approach this task.

Found that RL promotes better generalization than supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for training LLMs to plan Encrypted Section Part of this article is encrypted with password:\n--- DON'T MODIFY THIS LINE --- Future Vision Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have sparked intense interest in improving their reasoning and decision-making capabilities. My research brought me some thoughts about how to advance this field:\nA. Extend Enhancing VLM Reward Signals for Robust Learning Beyond Passive Defense: Active Mitigation of Noisy Language Rewards While my current work (e.g., the BiMI reward function) passively filters noisy language-based rewards, future systems need active strategies to preemptively address ambiguity and noise:\nLink to Reward Hacking: Investigate how natural language reward noise interacts with RL’s inherent vulnerability to reward hacking (e.g., agents exploiting shortcuts to maximize rewards while not performing the desired behavior). Actively mitigating reward hacking issue of RL algorithms can simultaneously benefit the overall VLM reward + RL framework.\nI actually quite concern about the log impact in the likelihood ratio policy gradient algorithms go check this blog, where we can avoid having $\\log$ issue and thus reduce gradient variance by using reparameterization trick. This NIPS paper also provide some promising results of Reparameterization Policy Gradient. Rethink Markovian Constraints: The inherent Markovian assumption of traditional RL, where rewards depend solely on the current state and action, presents a fundamental challenge when using natural language instructions. Language naturally expresses temporally extended objectives and relationships (e.g., “first, clear the table, then set the places,” or “avoid touching the hot stove while cooking”). Directly translating these instructions into Markovian rewards often leads to suboptimal learning. Research is needed into non-Markovian reward structures and corresponding RL algorithms that can naturally accommodate the long-horizon dependencies inherent in language-based instructions. This includes exploring formalisms like integrating temporal logic into RL framework and investigating how to theoretically guarantee the convergence and optimality of RL agents under such non-Markovian reward specifications.\nTrain Robust VLMs for Reward Modeling: A critical challenge in using natural language for reward specification is mitigating the inherent ambiguity and compositionality of language, which can lead to noisy and unreliable reward signals. While our current BIMI approach acts as a form of uncertainty-aware reward modeling, further research is needed to develop more robust VLM training mechanisms. This involves several key areas:\nExpand to see the details Disentangling Ambiguous Instructions: Natural language instructions often contain ambiguities that make it difficult for a VLM to accurately assess alignment with agent behavior. For example, in the instruction “go to the red dot,” is the reward associated with the action (“go to”) more or the object (“red dot”) more? This ambiguity stems from the compositional nature of language, where the meaning of a phrase arises from the combination of its individual parts. Future work should focus on developing techniques to disentangle the contributions of different components of the instruction (e.g., actions, objects, attributes) to the overall reward signal. This might involve attention mechanisms or contrastive learning approaches that force the VLM to distinguish between subtly different instructions. Beyond Scalar Rewards: Expressiveness and Compositionality: Continue the discussion, due to the compositionality of language, the traditional use of a single scalar reward signal to represent the alignment between agent behavior and a language instruction may be fundamentally insufficient. As highlighted in previous work, scalar rewards struggle to capture the compositional nature of language. This raises a crucial question: should we continue to rely on scalar rewards, or explore alternative representations that better reflect the richness of language? Research is needed to: Categorize types of instructions that are (and are not) adequately expressible with scalar rewards. Develop methods to transform or decompose instructions that are not well-represented by scalar rewards into forms that are more amenable to accurate reward modeling. This could again link back to using temporal logic expression and train RL with temporal logic specifications. Multi-Objective Language Rewards: As a direct response to the limitations of scalar rewards, we may explore Multi-Objective Language Rewards. For instance, a driving instruction might have separate reward components for “speed,” “safety,” and “adherence to traffic rules.” This allows the VLM to capture more granular intent and handle potentially conflicting objectives. Techniques like PSMGD can then be further investigated to effectively train agents using language instructions. Segmentation-based VLM reward: using segmented images for training VLMs as reward models can prevent noise issues. It also seems likely that training the segmentation vision encoder for new environments is more flexible than retraining the VLM, given the resource demands of the latter. Go check SAM 2 to implement this\nlow-hanging fruit: comparing VLM-based agents’ performance with instructions of varying abstraction levels Click for the details The research focuses on Vision-Language Model (VLM) embodied agents and how they follow instructions with different levels of abstraction—high-level (general and ambiguous, like “clean the room”) versus low-level (specific and detailed, like “pick up the red cup from the table”). I am interested in whether these agents learn faster with high-level, low-level, or mixed instructions, which connects to curriculum learning, where tasks are sequenced by difficulty to optimize learning.\nThe contribution is also significant,\nhuman communicates with different granularity of the instruction and therefore we want the embodied agents to also cope with this communication style. high-level is more general but ambiguous, low-level is easy to follow but require extensive expert knowledge to construct. We eventually want the agent to utilize more abstract instructions to reduce the burden of human instructors. [!NOTE]\nOur instruction is general (and we call it general policy), meaning it is not specific to certain problem instances but applies generally to all problem instances in the same domain. However, the general policy also has levels of granularity, with more abstract general policy constructed by a lesser number of features that are important to solving the problems, and low-level general policy constructed by a larger number of features that are important to problem-solving. Basically, this aligns with the Hector’s Sketch idea.\nConnection to existing VLM agents and instruction following\nIt appears that no existing research yet come up with this investigation. This research topic is novel. Check Grok search\nAccording to ChatGPT deep research, there are open gaps:\nsystematic studies of instruction abstraction are still limited, we lack clear data on how instruction granularity affects generalization and robustness in interactive learning. Integrating policy-sketch ideas with VLMs is another promising area. To our knowledge, no prior work explicitly feeds symbolic high-level sketches into a modern VLA agent; doing so could combine the best of both worlds (symbolic guidance + neural flexibility). In summary, promising directions include explicitly modeling instruction hierarchies, mixing granularities in training curricula, and bridging symbolic and neural planning. Connection to Curriculum Learning\nThis idea is distinct from curriculum learning. In curriculum learning, we feed RL agents tasks progressively from easy to difficult levels, allowing them to learn along a smooth gradient of complexity. The fundamental difference is that curriculum learning modifies task complexity. However, our research takes a different approach. Here, we aim to keep the underlying difficulty of the planning problem consistent across all conditions. Instead, the key variable we are manipulating is the abstraction level of the instructions provided to the VLM agent. We are not changing the inherent complexity of “cleaning the room” or “picking up a cup.” What differs is how these tasks are instructed – ranging from high-level, ambiguous descriptions to low-level, detailed steps.\nAlso check Grok search on Curriculum Learning for VLM embodied agents.\nVLM reasoning with noise\nJust like decision transformer, the VLM in this scenario will need to determine by itself whether or not the condition is satisfied (i.e., whether the current policy sketch is finished… Well… at the beginning we can read this completion information from the engine, but later we need to do it by ourselves). In real world automation, we need to rely on VLM itself to tell whether we proceed to the next policy sketch. So eventually the VLM will need to take in charge of\nReasoning of the current state (with noise) Decision-making We therefore need to see how to get the best learning efficiency through our dedicated learning methodology. For instance,\ngradually from low-level sketch to abstract sketch or vice versa, or mixed level of sketches (determine the best ratio), or learn reasoning first and then decision-making or vice versa, or learning both reasoning and decision making at the same time Also, how to handle noise and mis-information from the reasoning side. Implementation\nWe need oracle reward function to assign rewards when agents complete the instruction. This should be a easy thing to do.\nThe testing environments, we can use PDDLGym\nFor VLM embodied agent, we can use LLaRP\nAim: when only give high-level sketch, agent can also quickly solve the problem\nAspects that are important and need to be investigated\nEnvironment map size and training instance size\nWidth value of sketch\nrobust to noise (delayed communication and wrong perception)\nTraining ordering (train from detailed sketch to abstract sketch or mixed up?)\nAnalyze and understand the details about the Semantic representation of different level of sketch\nlatent vector of each layer from the policy adapter when they encode different different level of sketch Oracle reward model vs trained reward model (see which one is more robust to noise)\ntrained reward model shall train all level of sketch and trajectory pairs Ability to adapt to new environment.

Addressing the Challenges of LLMs in Planning The Core Debate: Is Next-Token Prediction Fundamentally Flawed for Planning?\nA critical question looms over LLM-based planning: Does the next-token prediction paradigm—the foundation of modern LLMs – inherently limit their ability to reason sequentially? Recent work highlights two opposing perspectives:\nCritiques: Papers like \"The Pitfalls of Next-Token Prediction\" argue that autoregressive training biases LLMs toward local coherence over global reasoning, making them prone to sequential reasoning. Studies from UC Berkeley and Google suggest supervised fine-tuning (SFT) exacerbates memorization, while reinforcement learning (RL) promotes generalization for reasoning. Counterarguments: Other researchers contend that next-token prediction itself is not the bottleneck. Instead, overfitting during training – not the paradigm – causes poor planning performance. This debate underscores a pivotal challenge: How do we disentangle the limitations of next-token prediction from training-induced overfitting?\nPotential Direction 1: Understanding the Theoretical Limits and Capabilities of Transformers for Planning While Potential Direction 1 focuses on mitigating overfitting to improve planning performance, this direction explores the inherent theoretical capabilities and limitations of the Transformer architecture itself for planning tasks. This investigation is crucial for understanding whether the observed difficulties stem primarily from training issues (as addressed in Direction 1) or from fundamental architectural constraints.\nWe can draw inspiration from recent work, such as the UC Berkeley study analyzing Transformer limitations in sequential function composition. Similarly, we can investigate whether current LLMs, based on the Transformer architecture, can theoretically derive correct plans given any planning task specifications. Even if LLMs are found to be primarily successful with in-distribution planning tasks, further research can also examine how architectural parameters, like layer depth and width, influence this in-distribution performance. This could involve developing formal proofs or rigorous empirical analyses to characterize the planning problems solvable by Transformers of varying configurations.\nA more concrete low hanging fruit potential research – RASP theoretical analysis\nWe can leverage theoretical frameworks like RASP to analyze whether LLMs can do automated planning and why certain planning algorithms can be more effectively learned than others.\nHypothesis behind RASP and Planning: The original RASP language defines a large set of programs which can be represented by Transformers, by hard-coding specific model weights. That means, if a planning algorithm can be encoded in the RASP language, it implies taht LLM can, in theory, solve planning problems. Building on this, we can empirically and theoretically explore which types of planning algorithms are most effectively learned by LLMs and how existing planning algorithms can be adapted to better align with LLM architectures and the next token prediction training paradigm. Direction 1 Variant: LLM + CoT Emulation of Planning Algorithms Above is mainly focusing on the Transformer expressiveness without Chain-of-Thought (CoT). On the other hand, the existing literature has already suggested that LLMs augmented with CoT prompting is Turing complete. That means, theoretically, LLM + CoT can simulate any planning algorithm. This implies that, in principle, LLMs can derive solutions to complex planning problems by emulating established algorithms (e.g., heuristic search, GraphPlan, partial-order planning). However, Turing completeness doesn’t guarantee efficient or robust learning. A critical open question is: which types of planning algorithms are LLMs most capable of learning and generalizing, and which are more resistant to overfitting?\nAddressing this question requires a two-pronged approach:\nEvaluation of various existing planning algorithms emulation through LLMs: We must rigorously test the performance of LLMs trained to simulate various planning algorithms on a diverse range of planning benchmarks, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. This empirical analysis will reveal which algorithmic approaches are most amenable to learning within the LLM framework. Crucially, even with a theoretical understanding of Transformer capabilities, practical training remains a significant challenge. The insights and techniques developed in Potential Direction 2, such as Learn with Minimum Confidence (LMC) and advanced RL methods, are directly relevant here. For instance, even if a particular planning algorithm is theoretically learnable, effective training strategies (e.g., specialized reward signals, curriculum learning) may be necessary to achieve robust performance in practice. Therefore, this direction is deeply intertwined with the pursuit of improved training methodologies. Potential Direction 2: Mitigating Overfitting to Unlock Planning Potential Assume next-token prediction can support planning if overfitting is addressed. To test this, I propose Learn with Minimum Confidence (LMC) (related but different from Curriculum Learning). Without this strategy, models may exploit pattern shortcut to solve reasoning problems, and the reasoning ability is overshadowed by patterns matching ability.\nIntuition behind LMC Consider the double-slit experiment in Physics. If a scientist had conduct the experiments millions of times, their mindset might have overfitted to the idea that light is exclusively a wave. However, by limiting observations and gradually introducing new scenarios, physicists developed a more general understanding of the wave-particle duality character of light. Core Idea:\nOnce an LLM solves a problem instance with high confidence, no more training on that instance and its close variants. This prevent the model from exploiting shortcuts to solve the training instances Key Steps:\nFrom LLM side $\\rightarrow$ Measure LLM Confidence: Develop metrics to quantify how “certain” the model is about its solutions (e.g., entropy of output probabilities). From training data size $\\rightarrow$ Assess Instance Novelty: Compute the “surprise” of incoming training instances relative to prior data (e.g., using novelty metrics like width). Advance RL-Based Training\nOne of the theory that RL performs better than SFT is RL is better at preventing overfitting. (I really found this is akin to GANs’ advantage over VAEs). Nonetheless, further addressing overfitting in RL could lead to even greater improvements.\nSidenote: Comparative Analysis of GANs and VAEs in Mitigating Overfitting The adversarial training paradigm inherent to GANs provides built-in defenses against overfitting through three principal mechanisms:\nAdaptive Loss Surfaces: The discriminator’s evolving feedback prevents static memorization patterns. Perceptual Optimization: Prioritizing distributional matching over pixel accuracy avoids noise overfitting. Dynamic Regularization: The adversarial equilibrium maintains pressure toward generalizable feature learning. Ensemble Normalization: Train multiple reward and policy models to average out biases and stabilize learning. Replay Buffer Prioritization: Weight training instances by their novelty (e.g., prioritizing scenarios with rare task instances or under-explored plan sequences). Reward Signal Design: Our work found that Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence (LCCS)-based partial rewards help. However, this is just one approach – it remains an open problem for better reward design. Low-hanging fruit: designing and examining different reward signals to support LLM RL training for plan generation click for details We have observed that RL training helps LLMs enhance both the validity and executability of generated plans.\nBackground\nPlan validity is a binary outcome that can only be determined when the planner declares it has completed planning. However, using validity alone as a reward signal creates a sparse learning environment.\nPreviously, we utilized Longest Contiguous Common Sequence (LCCS) to provide partial reward signals and create a smoother learning gradient. Yet it remains unexplored what other types of reward signals could be constructed to further facilitate learning.\nSeveral promising suggestions include:\nReward signals that measure exploration (state space coverage), encouraging LLMs to explore the state space more thoroughly Rewards based on how many landmarks are reached during planning Various planning heuristics adapted as reward signals Extra consideration\nWhen implementing multiple reward signals, we face key design questions: Should we activate them sequentially based on which aspects the LLM needs to improve at the current moment? Or should we aggregate them into a composite reward?\nLLM plan generation style\nWe need to enable LLMs to construct a tree for searching the problem space, allowing both forward propagation and backtracking. Restricting LLMs to generate only linear plan sequences inhibits their ability to perform the search process, which is essential for planning.\nLet’s team up!

We hypothesize that false positive rewards -- instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise. BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging embodied navigation environments. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of how different types of reward noise impact agent learning and highlight the importance of addressing multimodal reward signal noise when training embodied agents ICAPS25 Chasing Progress, Not Perfection: Revisiting Strategies for End-to-End LLM Plan Generation Sukai Huang, Trevor Cohn and Nir Lipovetzky 35th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling abstract paper code The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan remains a topic of debate. Some critics argue that strategies to boost LLMs' reasoning skills are ineffective in planning tasks, while others report strong outcomes merely from training models on a planning corpus. This study reassesses recent strategies by developing an end-to-end LLM planner and employing diverse metrics for a thorough evaluation. We find that merely fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets. At the same time, we find that various strategies, including Chain-of-Thought, do enhance the probability of a plan being executable. This indicates progress towards better plan quality, despite not directly enhancing the final validity rate. Among the strategies we evaluated, reinforcement learning with our novel `Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence' reward emerged as the most effective, contributing to both plan validity and executability. Overall, our research addresses key misconceptions in the LLM-planning literature; we validate incremental progress in plan executability, although plan validity remains a challenge. Hence, future strategies should focus on both these aspects, drawing insights from our findings.\nAAAI25 Planning in the Dark: LLM-Symbolic Planning Pipeline without Experts Sukai Huang, Nir Lipovetzky and Trevor Cohn Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence abstract paper code poster Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving natural language-described planning tasks, but their direct use often leads to inconsistent reasoning and hallucination. While hybrid LLM-symbolic planning pipelines have emerged as a more robust alternative, they typically require extensive expert intervention to refine and validate generated action schemas. It not only limits scalability but also introduces a potential for biased interpretation, as a single expert's interpretation of ambiguous natural language descriptions might not align with the user's actual intent. To address this, we propose a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to generate multiple candidates, accounting for the diverse possible interpretations of natural language descriptions. We further introduce a semantic validation and ranking module that automatically filter and rank the generated schemas and plans without expert-in-the-loop. The experiments showed our pipeline maintains superiority in planning over the direct LLM planning approach. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated end-to-end LLM-symbolic planner that requires no expert intervention, opening up the possibility for a broader audience to engage with AI planning with less prerequisite of domain expertise.\npreprint A Reminder of its Brittleness: Language Reward Shaping May Hinder Learning for Instruction Following Agents Sukai Huang, Nir Lipovetzky and Trevor Cohn arXiv ePrint 2023 abstract paper code Teaching agents to follow complex written instructions has been an important yet elusive goal. One technique for improving learning efficiency is language reward shaping (LRS), which is used in reinforcement learning (RL) to reward actions that represent progress towards a sparse reward. We argue that the apparent success of LRS is brittle, and prior positive findings can be attributed to weak RL baselines. Specifically, we identified suboptimal LRS designs that reward partially matched trajectories, and we characterised a novel type of reward perturbation that addresses this issue based on the concept of loosening task constraints. We provided theoretical and empirical evidence that agents trained using LRS rewards converge more slowly compared to pure RL agents.\nhonours thesis Angry Birds Level Generation Using Walkthrough Descriptions Sukai Huang For the degree of Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) at The Australian National University abstract paper Angry Birds is a famous environment for agents to learn physical reasoning. How- ever, the deep reinforcement learning agents often underperform due to a lack of training set of game levels. To address the issue, procedural level generation is used to synthesise new Angry Birds game levels. However, the current rule-based Angry Birds procedural level generator is incapable of generating game levels that aid agents in learning physical reasoning, as it cannot guarantee the level of physical reasoning required in order to solve the generated game levels. Hence, in a new approach, we use walkthrough descriptions to generate Angry Birds game levels and train the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based pro- cedural level generator by imitating the high-quality handcrafted levels. Unlike the conventional imitation approach, the proposed one is able to control the style of the generated game levels and also enhance the diversity of the game level dataset via manipulating the input walkthrough descriptions. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to demonstrate that the generated game levels using this method demand high level of physical reasoning to solve, just like the handcrafted game levels. Besides that, we developed a new Angry Birds walkthrough dataset called AbVat. It is a valuable dataset capable of facilitating a variety of meaningful research tasks in the domain of spatial-temporal understanding and reasoning.\n",

<p>Integrating natural language into current AI system is a promising direction to <strong>democratize AI technology</strong>. Moreover, the <strong>vast knowledge embedded</strong> in natural language presents an opportunity to enhance AI-driven decision-making.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you want to instruct an AI system in Minecraft to build a house. Instead of programming a detailed set of construction rules or crafting reward functions that require expert insight, you simply tell the AI:</p>
<p>  “Build a two-story house with a garden, using bricks for the walls and wood for the roof.”</p>
<p>A natural language (NL)-integrated sequential decision making (SDM) system shall leverage its understanding of natural language to break down this instruction into a series of actionable steps, and progressing to the desired goal you want!</p>

<p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to generate reward signals for training embodied agents to follow instructions, our research reveals that agents guided by VLM rewards often underperform compared to those employing only intrinsic (exploration-driven) rewards, contradicting expectations set by recent work. We hypothesize that false positive rewards -- instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise. BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging embodied navigation environments. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of how different types of reward noise impact agent learning and highlight the importance of addressing multimodal reward signal noise when training embodied agents </p>

<p>The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan remains a topic  of debate. Some critics argue that strategies to boost LLMs' reasoning  skills are ineffective in planning tasks, while others report strong  outcomes merely from training models on a planning corpus. This study  reassesses recent strategies by developing an end-to-end LLM planner and employing diverse metrics for a thorough evaluation. We find that  merely fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead  to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on  out-of-distribution test sets. At the same time, we find that various  strategies, including Chain-of-Thought, do enhance the probability of a  plan being executable. This indicates progress towards better plan  quality, despite not directly enhancing the final validity rate. Among  the strategies we evaluated, reinforcement learning with our novel  `Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence' reward emerged as the most  effective, contributing to both plan validity and executability.  Overall, our research addresses key misconceptions in the LLM-planning  literature; we validate incremental progress in plan executability,  although plan validity remains a challenge. Hence, future strategies  should focus on both these aspects, drawing insights from our findings.</p>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving natural language-described planning tasks, but their direct use often leads to inconsistent reasoning and hallucination. While hybrid LLM-symbolic planning pipelines have emerged as a more robust alternative, they typically require extensive expert intervention to refine and validate generated action schemas. It not only limits scalability but also introduces a potential for biased interpretation, as a single expert's interpretation of ambiguous natural language descriptions might not align with the user's actual intent. To address this, we propose a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to generate multiple candidates, accounting for the diverse possible interpretations of natural language descriptions. We further introduce a semantic validation and ranking module that automatically filter and rank the generated schemas and plans without expert-in-the-loop. The experiments showed our pipeline maintains superiority in planning over the direct LLM planning approach. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated end-to-end LLM-symbolic planner that requires no expert intervention, opening up the possibility for a broader audience to engage with AI planning with less prerequisite of domain expertise.</p>

<p>Teaching agents to follow complex written instructions has been an important yet elusive goal. One technique for improving learning efficiency is language reward shaping (LRS), which is used in reinforcement learning (RL) to reward actions that represent progress towards a sparse reward. We argue that the apparent success of LRS is brittle, and prior positive findings can be attributed to weak RL baselines. Specifically, we identified suboptimal LRS designs that reward partially matched trajectories, and we characterised a novel type of reward perturbation that addresses this issue based on the concept of loosening task constraints. We provided theoretical and empirical evidence that agents trained using LRS rewards converge more slowly compared to pure RL agents.</p>

<p>Angry Birds is a famous environment for agents to learn physical reasoning. How- ever, the deep reinforcement learning agents often underperform due to a lack of training set of game levels. To address the issue, procedural level generation is used to synthesise new Angry Birds game levels. However, the current rule-based Angry Birds procedural level generator is incapable of generating game levels that aid agents in learning physical reasoning, as it cannot guarantee the level of physical reasoning required in order to solve the generated game levels. Hence, in a new approach, we use walkthrough descriptions to generate Angry Birds game levels and train the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based pro- cedural level generator by imitating the high-quality handcrafted levels. Unlike the conventional imitation approach, the proposed one is able to control the style of the generated game levels and also enhance the diversity of the game level dataset via manipulating the input walkthrough descriptions. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to demonstrate that the generated game levels using this method demand high level of physical reasoning to solve, just like the handcrafted game levels. Besides that, we developed a new Angry Birds walkthrough dataset called AbVat. It is a valuable dataset capable of facilitating a variety of meaningful research tasks in the domain of spatial-temporal understanding and reasoning.</p>
