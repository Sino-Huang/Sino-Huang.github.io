It refers to the model’s ability to compose learned concepts—such as colors, shapes or relationships—in novel ways at test time, even though those specific combinations never appeared during training.\nFor example, if a model is trained on commands like “Point to the blue circle” and “Point to the yellow square,” it should still understand “Point to the blue square” at test time. To succeed, the Neuro-Symbolic VLM must separately recognize the concepts of “blue” and “square,” then compose them—even though “blue square” was never seen during training.\nIn NeSyCoCo, each concept—like “blue,” “square,” or “circle”—is treated as a Boolean predicate. During training, the model extracts an object feature vector $X_{obj}$ from the visual encoder and a predicate embedding $E$ from the language encoder. These two vectors are fed into a small feed-forward network (FFN), which produces a sigmoid output indicating whether the predicate is true (1) or false (0) for that object.\nThe FFN is trained on a predefined set of predicates, but because it operates on the language encoder’s embeddings, it can generalize to new, semantically similar words. For example, although the network may only have seen “blue” during training, it can correctly evaluate “azure” at test time ($\\text{blue}(X)\\approx\\text{azure}(X)$), and likewise map “large” to “huge” ($\\text{large}(X)\\approx\\text{huge}(X)$). However, this approach cannot extend further when the model encounters completely novel concepts that have no close analogue in the trained predicate set—true “alien” predicates fall outside its current generalization capabilities. (e.g., $\\text{onFire}(X)$ cannot be processed if $\\text{onFire}$ or any similar concepts are not involved during training)\nLimitation of this work -\u003e the quality of the training data Composite prompts outperform atomic prompts.\nDownstream text-conditioned detectors/segmenters (e.g., DINO variants, SAM with prompts) often localize “fish ball” more accurately than “ball”, because the composite phrase matches the entangled representation learned from captions. The atomic prompt is too generic and polysemous—so the model’s “ball” concept is fuzzy and drifts to any spherical object. Example: In a street-food photo with a skewer of fish balls, prompting “fish ball” yields tight masks on the skewered items; prompting just “ball” either returns nothing or highlights unrelated round objects (lanterns, oranges, ping-pong balls), revealing that the model never disentangled fish-ball-ness from the generic “ball.”\nThe generalization performance of Policy Sketch VLA is about task decomposition into subproblems I realize that Hector Geffner’s Policy sketch is another type of compositional generalization – it is not about property concept composition that focuses on the entities, it is about decomposing a task into subproblems.\nBefore that, let’s define what is a feature — A Boolean (resp. numerical) feature for a problem $P$ is a function that maps reachable states into Boolean values (resp. non-negative integers).\nSo the difference between this and NeSyCoCo is that NeSyCoCo focuses the feature (concept) of entity (e.g., $\\text{Blue}(X)$) while Hector Geffner’s focus is a bit broader — feature of states ($e.g., distance(agent, box_{\\text{closest}})$) Policy sketch is a set of rules where each rule is a rule of the form $C \\mapsto E$ where condition $C$ is a set (conjunction) of boolean feature condition and the effect $E$ is a set (conjunction) of feature value changes.\nAt this moment, Hector’s feature value changes are of the form of $p, \\neg p, p?$ for boolean $p$ ($p?$ means $p$ is updated but do not know the actual value) and $n\\uparrow, n\\downarrow, n?$ for numerical $n$.\n[!NOTE]\nThese numerical updates do not support arbitrary arithmetic (e.g. “add 7” or “multiply by 2”). They only express that a quantity goes up, goes down, or changes. This limitation arises because the theoretical guarantees (on convergence, complexity, etc.) for policy sketches—and most classical planners more generally—do not handle full numerical planning.\nPlay with the granularity of policy sketch, feature reuse, and compositional generalization to unseen tasks The information in this section is a bit dense and unstructured. Currently I have not yet find a good way to convey it in a more structured way. I hope that Lizhen can grasp my idea from this “messy” information.\nI am now claiming the following statement\nPolicy Sketch Rules. A Policy Sketch (per Hector Geffner) is a set of rules $r\\colon C \\mapsto E$. Each rule specifies a precondition $C$ (a conjunction of Boolean feature tests) and an effect $E$ (a conjunction of feature‐value updates). To execute a rule, the agent must carry out one or a sequence of actions that move the world from any state satisfying $C$ into a state satisfying $E$.\nside notes: policy sketch is about state’s feature value change, thus it decouples from the actual actions an agent can perform for each environments. $\\rightarrow$ this enable use to reuse the VLA’s VL part Sketch‐Driven Control Flow. a sketch $R$ is defined in a way that, whenever a rule $r \\in R$ is achieved, it always activates one or more successor rules $r’$ (i.e.\\ their preconditions $C$ become true). The agent then greedily selects any available rule and repeats until the goal is reached. Crucially, this shifts the global search burden: the agent only needs to plan within each rule—from its $C$ to its $E$. but at the sketch selection level, they just need to greedily follow any one of them\nside notes: a trivial method can verify whether the designed (or generated) $R$ fulfills this property, if not, ask LLMs to rectify it. Feature‐Based Granularity. Each rule $r$ is built using a set of features $f(s)$. The number and quality of these features determine the sketch’s granularity:\nIn the package‐delivery example, a Width = 0 sketch is made of more features , thus low-level granularity A Width = 2 sketch is made of fewer features and thus high‐level granularity. Impact on Planning Complexity. The sketch’s granularity directly affects how hard it is for a classical planner to find the action sequence that achieve each rule:\nWith a low‐level sketch (many detailed features), a classical planner can more easily solve the subproblem $C\\to E$. We hypothesize that replacing the classical planner with a learning‐based action model will likewise speed up learning from demonstrations when those demonstrations use a low‐level sketch $R$. With these points in place, we are now exploring the following research problems:\nFeature- and Sketch-Level Compositional Generalization Sketch composition. Examine the agent’s performance for new tasks whose policy sketch $R_{\\text{new}}$ recombine existing rules ${r}$ in those training policy sketches ${R}_{train}$. Feature composition. More challengingly, can we extend to tasks that require synthesizing entirely new rules $r_{\\text{new}}$ by composing learned features $f(s)$? Research question. To what extent can a sketch-guided Vision-Language Agent generalize under each type of composition? Curriculum Learning over Sketch Granularity Low- vs. high-level sketches. Low-level (fine-grained) sketches speed up learning but risk overfitting to training task instances; high-level (abstract) sketches are slower but more robust. Curriculum design. What mix of low- and high-granularity sketches (mix-ratio, learning strategy: e.g., RL for low-level $R$, SFT for high-level $R$ vs SFT for low-level $R$, RL for high-level $R$. etc. ) in the training set maximizes intra-domain performance? Research question. How should we sequence or weight sketch granularities to achieve the best trade-off between sample efficiency and generalization? Inter-Domain Transfer via Shared High-Level Sketches Domain gap. Some tasks (e.g. Sokoban) lack low-level sketches—actions are restricted (only pushes) and may require “undo” maneuvers—whereas delivery tasks allow arbitrary pick without requiring “undo” subgoals. Shared abstraction. Both domains share the same high-level goal (“reduce the number of undelivered boxes”). Research question. Can skills learned in Sokoban transfer to package-delivery tasks—and vice versa—or do the differing action constraints (e.g., Sokoban’s push-only moves and box blocking versus unrestricted pick-and-carry and no road blocking) cause package-delivery training to impede Sokoban performance despite their shared high-level goal? Next steps for Lizhen: I would like Lizhen to review these three directions, share any concerns or suggestions, and point us to relevant literature or competing neuro-symbolic agents that we should consider. Thanks in advance!\nLiterature of Hector’s Policy Sketch Learning Sketches for Decomposing Planning Problems into Subproblems of Bounded Width: Extended Version General Policies, Subgoal Structure, and Planning Width On Policy Reuse: An Expressive Language for Representing and Executing General Policies that Call Other Policies Solution for detecting completion $s$ and $s’$ two images VLM detecting feature value changes. Recall the definitions Sy (symbolic-only): predicates/rules (e.g., blue(x) ∧ ball(x)). rules: preference of some state transition. Ne (neural-only): learns mapping/alignment from data/demonstration. NeSy (neuro-symbolic): neural perception + symbolic reasoning layered together. Advantages \u0026 limitations (with examples) Sy — great at compositional generalization\nPros Naturally composes known predicates: from blue and ball you get “blue ball”. Interpretable: you can inspect rules and proofs. Data efficient once the ontology is defined. Cons Coverage gaps: if a needed predicate wasn’t defined, the system can’t use it. Example: training covered “robot arm holding cup,” but not the predicate brittle; faced with an egg, it lacks “brittle(x)” and can’t adjust. Rely on perception performance. Ne — strong at semantic similarity\nPros Handles unseen concepts by proximity in embedding space (finds “closest known thing”). Robust to messy data; learns features automatically. Cons Weak at compositional generalization; tends to overfit patterns seen together. Example: trained on A+B and B+C; at test time, A+C often fails. NeSy — combines the two\ncan deal with compositional generalization that pure Ne cannot do can form novel symbolic concept during the test time Here’s a crisp, speakable version you can share.\nLevel of generalization Take the apple type with attributes like:\nshape: ball/round color: red (atomic value) is_brittle: false (predicate) …and so on. 1) Generalization on the entity (attributes/features) E1 — Seen attribute, new value (value-level generalization) You’ve learned the attribute, but not this value.\nExample: only trained on color=red, now sees color=green → “green apple.” E2 — Unseen attribute (schema-level generalization) A brand-new predicate/field appears.\nExample: is_ready_to_serve wasn’t in the training schema; the system must infer or add it. (maybe assume this is derived predicate) 2) Generalization on the policy sketch (rules) A policy sketch = a set of [precondition] → [effect] clauses.\nP1 — New combinations of seen statements (compositional recombination) All the individual preconditions/effects were seen, but their combination is new.\nA -\u003e B (seen), C -\u003e D (seen) understand B -\u003e C P2 — Unseen statement form, built from seen features (structural generalization) The features (color, size, brittleness) are known, but they form new sketch $r$\nIdea: Ternary state indicator for the action model action model may take a multi-hot encoding vector to record the policy sketch\nunknown (0), activated (1), deactivated (-1) for each predicates we leave placeholder to be unknown value (0) The context is\nyou have a plenty of action sequence of solve an existing sketch $r$. now the $r$ suddenly changes, e.g., previously we just ask you to pick up balls, and all the training balls are table tennis ball, now we ask you to pickup egg (which is brittle). then there are some actions can still do it well, some fails as eggs just break (assume the diversity of the action policy under the sketch $r$) the new predicate is_brittle becomes important in the new task and thus for the previous $r$, the is_brittle value there is 0, as we do not know if that is an important predicate, but now, we can finetune the action model with 1 for those actions that can successfully pickup the eggs, and those -1 for those actions that fail to pickup the eggs.
